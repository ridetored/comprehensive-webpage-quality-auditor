## Features

### Meta Title and Description Extraction:
- The script searches for <title> and <meta name="description"> tags and extracts keywords from them to evaluate relevance.
- Keywords are cleaned and standardized to facilitate comparison with the page's content.

### Word Count and Content Extraction:
- The script calculates the total number of words on the page and extracts keywords from the visible text content.
- It compares these content keywords with the title and description keywords to determine a content relevance score, which indicates how well the content aligns with the page's primary topics.

### Image Alt Text and Relevance:
- Evaluates if images on the page have alt attributes.
- Checks whether the alt text contains keywords related to the title and description, which can impact SEO and accessibility.
